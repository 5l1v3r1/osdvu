      1) Accepts baud_rate and clock_rate as parameters.  Auto calculates
         clock_divide.
      
      2) Now uses localparam to prevent parameter modification.

      3) Partially developed test bench, added hooks to see internal operation.  
         These should probable be removed in the future... 

      4) Eliminated warnings from the XILINX ISE 14.4 synthesizer
